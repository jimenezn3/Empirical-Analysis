# Empirical-Analysis

Small program to compare the number of times an array must be accessed depending on whether it is randomly initialized, or sorted in ascending and descending order. The numbers are then used to calculate the algorithm's time efficiency and to estimate the time efficiency of an array of size 25,000 items.
